# Digital Signal Processing

Welcome to the Digital Signal Processing repository! This repository contains examples and explanations of various digital signal processing (DSP) techniques implemented in Python. The primary focus is on designing and applying different types of filters (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and band-stop) to signals with multiple frequencies.
